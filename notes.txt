 - add bpm selector (& optional tick?)
 - add quantization selector (16th, 8th, etc.)

- get qwerty to light up



structure:
    - maybe pressQwerty logic should be a container for Qwerty?
    - where to put download logic?
        - maybe in a container for Download button?


how much functionality do i want here?
    - switch sounds
    - change note octaves
    - write midi time signatures and bpm
    - disable qwerty sounds in
